The type of the third argument determines which `+` operator is used and is the type
that `accumulate` returns. The type of literal `0` is `int`, so the `+` operator for
`int` is used and the type returned by `accumulate` is `int`. Consequently, we will lose
all the decimals in the resulting accumulation.
