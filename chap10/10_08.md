Algorithms do not perform container operations, so they have no way themselves to change the
size of a container. However, they might do this indirectly through the insert iterator, but the
changes of the container size are made by the insert iterator, not the algorithms. Nontheless,
an algorithm cannot <b>directly</b> change the size of a container by itself.
