A `list` does not support random access, and element of `list` are stored
separately in memory. There is no need to reallocate its elements, and thus
no need to preallocate memory. So `list` does not have a `capacity` member.

An `array` is fixed-size, so it is redundant to have a `capacity` member which
is always the same as the `size` member.
