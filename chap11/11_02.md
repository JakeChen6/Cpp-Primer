`list`: when we need to insert/delete in the middle frequently.

`vector`: when we need a sequence that can grow dynamically in runtime.

`deque`: when most of the operations happen at either the front or the back.

`map`: when we need a data structure mapping one thing to another thing.

`set`: when we want to check whether a value is present.
