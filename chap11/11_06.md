They can both store elements of one type, but they do it differently, hence are used in different scenarios.

A `set` maintains the order of its elements. When we insert a new element into a `set`, the location of that inserted element is determined by the `set`, not the user, therefore we can't choose an arbitrary position at which to store that element. In contrast, a `list` doesn't maintain the order of its elements and the user can specify where to store the new elements.

`set` supports efficient lookup and is appropriate to use when we just want to check whether an element is present.  
`list` supports storing the elements in arbitrary positions and is suitable to use when we want to decide where to store the elements.
