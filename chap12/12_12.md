1. legal. Copying `sp` into `ptr` increments `sp`'s reference count. When `process` completes, the reference count of `sp` is decremented. Ultimately the reference count of `sp` is still 1.

2. illegal. The smart pointer constructors that take pointers are explicit. Hence, we cannot implicitly convert a built-in pointer to a smart pointer.

3. illegal. Same reason as above.

4. legal. But the memory that `p` points will be deleted. The temporary shared pointer is destroyed when the statement finishes, then the reference count becomes 0, and the memory to which the temporary points is freed.
