pros
* We can pass an initializer list to functions that require a StrBlob object thanks to the implicit conversion.
* We can use assignment to assign an initializer list to a StrBlob object (implicit conversion again).

cons
* we may overlook the implicit conversion made by the compiler sometimes, which may be bug-prone.
